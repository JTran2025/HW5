## Description
This project uses the jQuery User Interface (UI) library to create a small game of Scrabble. More specifically, it uses the Drag-and-Drop feature to drag and drop Scrabble tiles between the game board and the tile rack.

## Features
Letter tiles in the player’s “hand” are selected randomly from a data structure with the proper
distribution of the letters.
    I believe I was able to get this feature to partially work because I do not know if I got the distribution right.
    
Letter tiles can be dragged-and-dropped onto target Scrabble squares.
    I believe I was able to get this feature to work.

Program identifies which letter tile is dropped onto which Scrabble square.
    I believe I was able to get this to work.

Board includes at least two bonus squares.
    I believe I was able to get this feature to partially work because it recognizes the bonus squares but does not make the correct calculations.

Score is tallied correctly, including consideration of bonus square multipliers.
    I could not get this feature to work. I was able to get a score to tally, just not the correct value.

Any number of words can be played until the player wishes to quit or depletes all tiles.
    I believe I was able to get this feature to work.

The board is cleared after each round so that a new word can be played.
    I believe I was able to get this feature to work.

After playing a word, only the number of letter tiles needed to bring the player’s “hand” back
to 7 tiles are selected.
    I believe I was able to get this feature to work.

Score is kept for multiple words until the user restart a new game (implement next vs. restart).
    I believe I was able to get this feature to work.
    
Tiles can only be dragged from the “rack” to Scrabble board. If the user drop them anywhere
else, they will be bounced back to the “rack”.
    I believe I was able to get this feature to work.
    
Once the tile is placed on the Scrabble board, it can be moved back to the “rack”.
    I believe I was able to get this feature to work.

Except for the first letter, all sub-subsequent letters must be placed directly next to or below
another letter with no space. Else, they will bounce back to the “rack”.
    I was unable to get this feature to work.
    
User can always restart the game.
    I believe I was able to get this feature to work.
